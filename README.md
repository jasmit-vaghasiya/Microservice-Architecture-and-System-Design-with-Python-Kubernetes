# Microservice Architecture and System Design with Python & Kubernetes

This repository contains a sample project demonstrating the implementation of microservice architecture using Python for service development and Kubernetes for container orchestration.

## Overview

Microservice architecture is a design approach where a complex application is broken down into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This project showcases how to design, develop, deploy, and manage microservices using Python and Kubernetes.

## Features

- **Python Microservices**: Each microservice is implemented using Python, taking advantage of its simplicity, readability, and extensive library ecosystem.
- **Containerization with Docker**: Microservices are containerized using Docker, allowing for consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Orchestration with Kubernetes**: Kubernetes is used to manage and orchestrate the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of microservices in a distributed environment.
- **Communication via RESTful APIs**: Microservices communicate with each other through RESTful APIs, enabling seamless interaction between different components.
- **Database Integration**: Demonstrates various database integration patterns suitable for microservices, such as using shared databases, distributed databases, or event sourcing.
- **Scalability and Resilience**: The system is designed to scale horizontally and handle failures gracefully through resilient design practices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Kubernetes (minikube or a cloud provider's Kubernetes cluster)
- Python

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/microservice-python-kubernetes.git
   ```

2. Build Docker images for each microservice:

   ```bash
   cd microservice-python-kubernetes
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. Deploy microservices to Kubernetes cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
   ```

4. Access the services through their respective endpoints.

## Architecture

The architecture of the system is designed around the principles of microservice architecture. Each microservice focuses on a specific domain or functionality and communicates with other microservices via RESTful APIs. Kubernetes is used for container orchestration, ensuring high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.
